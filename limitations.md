# Limitations and Assumptions

## x86 Instructions
We implmented a minimal but quite usable subset of x86-64, including most control flow and integer arithmetic instructions.  Important limitations to note include
* No floating point instructions or registers.
* No support for the x86 AF (auxiliary / half-carry) and PF (parity) flags
*
